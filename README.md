# Algorithm Repository

Welcome to the Algorithm Repository! This repository contains a wide range of algorithms and problem-solving exercises categorized by type and difficulty. It is organized into three main sections: categorized algorithms, daily exercises, and past programming questions from major competitions.

## File Structure

### Categories
The `category` directory is divided into several subcategories, each focusing on different types of algorithms and data structures.

- **Basic Baejoon**: Basic problems from the Baekjoon Online Judge platform.
- **Basics**: Fundamental algorithms and data structures.
- **BruteForce**: Brute force algorithm problems.
- **Check Weakness**: Problems designed to check and strengthen algorithmic weaknesses.
- **DataStructure**: Basic data structures and related problems.
- **DataStructure2**: Advanced data structures.
- **Debug_Test**: Problems focusing on debugging skills.
- **Dynamic Programming 1**: Introduction to dynamic programming.
- **Recursion**: Problems involving recursive algorithms.
- **Sort**: Sorting algorithms and related problems.

### Day-by-Day
The `day-by-day` directory contains daily exercises, organized by groups of ten days. Each group contains individual directories for each day. This task is on a temporary break, but will resume as soon as time permits.

- **day1~10**: Daily exercises for the first 10 days.
  - day1
  - day2
  - day3
  - ...
  - day10
- **day11~20**: Daily exercises for days 11 to 20.
  - day11
  - day12
